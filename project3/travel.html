Becuase of this, there are several different ways that visitors can get to Plitvice. The main places people travel from are Zagreb, the nation's capital, or Zadar, a large town on the cost of Croatia, a small ways away from Plitvice.

    <p>Plitvice Lakes is very unique from other parks in that there are numerical, as well as alphabetical trails. Each type of hiking experience offers unique views and adventures, all of which promise beautiful overlooks of the Lakes, and the surrounding areas. The alphabetical routes are represented by letters (listed below) and generally are listed on large signs by the main entrances of the park. Differentiating themselves the hiking routes generally have wooden or well-kept dirt walking paths, with a set start and end point. These routes are very direct and tend to bring visitors around the park to the main attractions of Plitvice Lakes. Because these routes feature many photo-stops while also offering convenient and accessible walking paths, they usually attract a lot of tourists (who sometimes arrive as tour groups), making them generally more crowded than the numeric hiking trail options. For this reason, many opt to use the numerical trails, in order to avoid large crowds especially during peak vistor times (generally in June, July, and early August). Unlike the alphabetical hiking routes, the numeric hiking trails offered at Plitvice are represented by numbers and generally do not have one set start and one set destination. This allows visitors to choose their own way, and their own starting and ending points for their hike. For example, unlike the alphabetical hiking trails, it is easy to take a hike where you take trail 1 to trail 2 to trail 3 and so on, while allowing you to return the way you came (while most of the alphabetical hiking routes are a large circular path). The numeric hiking trails are typically well-maintained dirt paths along with wooden pathways that are somewhat less commonly traveled by visitors. In order to get between the Lower and Upper Lakes, boats and trams are needed. Each transport runs often, and is comfortable for your short journey.</p>
