        <h3>About Plitvice</h3>
        <p>The oldest and largest National Park in Croatia, Plitvice Lakes is known for its sea-green waters, surreal hiking trails, massive lakes, and many waterfalls. With over a million visitors each year, Plitvice Lakes is a popular attraction among locals and tourists alike, and is considered a must-see by many whenever in the area. Open year round, Plitvice Lakes is notorious for its beauty throughout every season, and has both dirt and wooden pathway trails and routes. Plitvice Lakes' lake system consists of 16 named lakes, along with many other smaller, unnamed lakes. The lakes at Plitvice are separated into the Upper Lakes, consisting of twelve named lakes, and the Lower Lakes, consisting of the other four named lakes. Aside from location, the main differences between the Upper and Lower Lakes are that the Upper Lakes were formed on top of impermeable domolmite rock, are generally larger, and typically have gentler shores. The Lower Lakes on the other hand are formed on top of permeable limestone and are cut into a canyon with cliffs. To travel from the Upper Lakes to the Lower Lakes (or vice versa), boat rides are offered. Though the lakes are generally considered the most attractive area of the park, they only cover about 1% of the total park area, while forest and smaller areas under grasslands take up the rest of the park area.</p>

        <h3>Surrounding Area</h3>
        <p>Within Croatia, Plitvice Lakes is located in a mountainous region between the Mala Kapela mountain range and the Lička Plješivica, and is just under 300 square kilometers large. Because of its size and where it is situated, the park overlaps into two different counties in Croatia: Lika-Senj and Karlovac. While not particularly close any major Croatian city like Dubrovnik or Zagreb, Plitvace Lakes is located near Zadar, a north-western coastal town that is home to the <a id="external-link" href="https://www.zadar.travel/en/city-guide/attractions/19-04-2007/sea-organ#.XLVAGqeZNQI">"Sea Organ"</a>. While Plitvice Lakes can serve as a beautiful day trip or a multi-day hiking advanture, so can many of the park's surrounding attractions (like Zadar). Though there is a hotel within the park, many visitors stay in the small Croatian towns that surround Plitvice Lakes, or in Zadar.</p>


        <h3>Personal Note</h3>
        <p>Personally, I have had the opportunity to visit Plitcive Lakes in June of 2018. I was able to make the trip to Plitvice durring my first ever trip to Europe, through a study aborad program. Previous to actually being in Plitvice, I knew nothing about the park aside from the fact that it was supposedly 'pretty', but it is actually so much more. I can honestly say that visiting Plitvice Lakes was an unreal and life-changing experience for me. It has made me more adventurous, and has shown me that not every situation needs to go as planned in order to be perfect. From this trip, I have also learned about Croatia, traveling tips, and must-see spots (see personal notes below). Through this web page, it is my goal to try and share some of the beauty that Plitvice Lakes holds, while also informing about the Lakes, their history, and my experiences, with those who are interested.</p>
