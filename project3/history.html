    <h1>History</h1>

    <p>While Plitvice Lakes is the first national park in Croatia, there is actually a much deeper history to Plitvice Lakes than most realize. While many protected natural areas are located quite far away from civilization, allowing for the preservation of its beauty, Plitvice Lakes has always been vulnerable to human interaction and influence. Often a meeting place for Western European and East Asian countries, Plitvice Lakes is located right along a very important transport route. As a result of these factors and more, the Plitvice Lakes area has been inhabited for thousands of years filled with inter-contidental conflicts, discovery, and eventual peace.</p>

    <h3>Early History</h3>

    <p>In the early history of Plitvice Lakes, there were a wide variety of different settlers who occupied the land, as ownership of the land switched rather quickly and drastically. Under the rule of Julius Ceasar, the Plitvice Lakes region was incoprotated into the Roman Empire as the province of Illyricum. United into the province of Dalmatia were the areas of three neighborly tribes: the Pannonians, the Loburnians, and Dalmatians. Following this and the Battle of Nedao (in 454), the Ostrogoths took over rule through a federation agreement with the Roman Empire. Accompanied by the Croats, Avars settled in the Plitvice region during the 6th century. However, the Croats soon defied the Avar's control and settled permanently in the region. While settled there in midieval times, the Mongols frequently attacked the Croats, threatening the population. Despite this, they persisted. The Plitvice region ended up forming the midieval kingdom of 'Croatia'. Later in 1103, this kingdom came to be in personal union with Hungary. With the rule of the Zrinsku and Frankopan families (along with the other Croat rulers), economic recovery was made in the wider area. A monastery (presumably owned by the Order of Sain Paul the First Hermit or the Knights Templars) was built in the remains of an ancient Japod and Roman settlement. In today's Plitivice Lakes, only wall remains exist.</p>

    <h3>Ottoman Wars &amp; the Habsburgs</h3>
    <p>In 1493 a monumental battle in Croatian history took place near Plitvice Lakes called the Battle of Krbava Field. This battle between the Austrian and Ottoman Empires resulted in the killing of almost all of the living Croatian nobility. The Ottomans proceeded to advance up to both Croatia and Hungary. In hope of receiving resources to ward off the Ottoman's advance, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria (the Habsburg monarch) as the King of Croatia. Despite this, the area fell to the Ottomans in 1528, but then was eventually taken back by the Habsburgs 150 years later. In 1538, the Croatian Military Frontier was established as a boarderland of the Habsburg Austria (to the Ottoman Empire). Becuase of this situation, the laws in the area had a significant impact on the locals, and many abandoned the special regime in favor of the West. With the native Croats inhabiting the area and serving in the Austrian military, many others migrated to the area where they exchanged military service for refuge in abandoned areas. These frontiersmen (the population of the military frontier) had the job of protecting this region of unrest and destruction. Plitvice Lakes continued on switch rule frequently as the Ottomans continued to pursue the area. Desite this, Plitvice Lakes was returned permanently to Habsburg rule in 1788. With this, the previous 'military frontier' was returned to the control of the Croatian civilian rulers, forming the Banovina of Croatia (which was located in Yugoslavia), a territory which contained Plitvice. This territory later became part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (which was located in the Socialist Yugoslavia). Today, Croatia is its own indepependent country: the Republic of Croatia, and Plitvice Lakes remain one of its largest attractions. In 1805, there was a major economic improvement due to a rule change, as Dalmatia and Lika fell under the rule of Napoleon who in turn founded the Illyrian provinces. Despite this period of success, Plitvice fell back under Habsburg rule in 1814. Around 45 years later, Croatia was in a time of national awakening. In 1871, Eugen Kvaternick - a famous polititian who advocated for Croatia's separation from Austrian-Hungarian predominance - was killed just north of the Lakes causing controversy. Despite this, Austrian authorities put down this Croatian rebellion.</p>

    <p>Though Plitvice Lakes has numerous irreplacable natural values, the local population in the past did not realize this potential. Farmers on the land generally focused on having food to put on the table for their families in a time of political (and somewhat social) gloom, which was also accompanied by negative changes to nature (including dried lakes, or people adapting resources to best fit their needs). Early on in 1861, lodging was built for travelers and was called Velika Poljana, which was called the "Emperor's House" by locals due to military offers often residing here. In 1888, Plitvice Lakes was arranged for tourist purposes for the first time in hisotry for the visit of Crown Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, the wife of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Two of the paths in Plitvice today even have the names of Emperor Franz Joseph's daughters: "Stephanie's Path" and "Dorothea's Path". In 1890, a tradesman built the first hotel with a restaurant in Plitivice near Prošćansko Lake which sadly left irreverable damage on the natural surroundings that can still be seen today. Today, a hotel and restaurant called Labudovac is now in this location and was built by Gustav Janeček. In 1893, Janeček founded the "Society for the Beautification of Plitvice Lakes and their Environs", with the goal of preserving the Lakes after all they had been through. As the Lakes became more built-up with hotels, doners gave money to help preserve this national treasure. In 1916 during WWI, the Law on the Protection of the Plitvice Lakes was passed. Though there were flaws with this law, it brought Plitvice one step closer to becoming a National Park. As time continued, preservation efforts eventually reached a deadlock. Despite this, many important meetings during WWII took place in Plitvice, making it a region of major political traffic.</p>

    <h3>Plitvice Lakes National Park</h3>
    <p>Following WWII, Plitvice Lakes was finally recognized for the beautiful natural phemonema that it is permanently. In 1949, Plitvice Lakes was finally declared a national park area, ushering in nature protection measures. In the 1960s, the Lakes became more accessible to visitors through the connection of a road, and the building of hotels and other attractions. Movies were filmed at the Lakes, and detailed land registers were recorded of the park. Soon after this, the park was inscribed on the UNESCO World National Heritage List. In the 80s, tourism at the Lakes was greatly increasing, making it one of Yugoslavia's most popular tourist attractions. However, in 1991, it became the sceen of the first armed confrontation of the Croatian War of Independence, resulting in casualties and was deemed the Plitvice Lakes Incident (or "Plitvice Bloody Easter"). While the Serb forces loyal to Belgrade did take over the region for a period of time, the Croatian Army in 1995 took it back. During the war from 1991 to 1995, the park's nature were at risk due to use of weaponry and mines, and it was place on UNESCO World National Heritage List in Danger. After the war, the mines were removed and it was taken off of the UNESCO World National Heritage List in Danger. In 2000 the park expanded further by 102 km squared. Currently, several differnent scientific research projects are continuously being carried out. The national park administration hopes to introduce more progressive and protective measures, such as potentially replacing the current wodden bridges with floating pontoon bridges as a preventative measure to avoid cracks of weak rock. Today, Plitvice Lakes is one of the most popular attractions in Croatia, and continues to be a massive force in the local economy.</p>
