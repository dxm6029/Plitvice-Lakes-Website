    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <h6>Image From Scratch</h6>
    <p>For my image from scratch, I used photographs I took on my trip to Plitvice Lakes, exported them, resized them, then enhanced several of them. These photographs are the transitioning images on the About Page, the header of the History, Travel, Gallery, and Resources pages, and several images on the gallery page (first column: image 4, 5, second column: image 1, 2, 3, 4, third column: image 2, 3, 4, 5). In enhancing the images, I created several adustment layers, used patching and correcting tools to remove people and distracting portions of images, used the paint brush tool on the layer masks of the adjustment layers (to manipulate which portions of the images were imapacted by the adjustment), and used the burn and dodge tool to add some more color and brightness balance to the images.</p>
    
    <h6>Embedded Media</h6>
    <p>The main piece of embedded media I used was a YouTube video that walks viewers through one of the trails at Plitvice Lakes. This is located in the "travel" section of the website (travel.html). I also included an external link to an informative article about "the Sea Organ" on my "about" section (index.html).</p>
    
    <h6>Rollover Effect</h6>
    <p>The image on this site that uses the CSS image rollover effect is the map in the "travel" section. This image zooms in slightly when hovered over.</p>
    
    <h6>JavaScript</h6>
    <p>For this project, I made a copyright message using Javascript, marking the website as my intellectual property. While the text itself can be displayed using HTML and CSS, I chose to use JavaScript for this so that the date year listed on the bottom of the page can update as time passes, making it more flexible. I made the string with JavaScript, and also centered the element by linking my HTML and JavaScript code.</p>
    
    <h6>Additional Transitions</h6>
    <p>For this web page, I used CSS transitions in a few different places consistently on each page of the site. In the header of each page, there is a large image, with text telling the location of the image in the lower right hand corner. If the text is hovered over, it fades out and the image can be viewed without text. I also used CSS transitions on my navigation bar. When hovering over an element on the navigation bar, the text size increases, and the background color transitions into a lighter green color. Lastly, on my 'about' page, there is an image that transitions between two different images every two seconds.</p>
    
    <h6>Summary</h6>
    <p>The main goal of this website is to share some information with viewers about Plitvice Lakes, including a bit about its history, what it is like to walk around Plitvice today, and its beauty. I feel like some of the best factors of this site are large strides towards achieving this goal. Personally, my favorite part of the website is the gallery page, as it very obviously shows how beautiful Plitvice Lakes is, in a very organized and professional way. Another factor that I am particularly proud of are the headers of the pages, as I took most of the images used for the headers, personally enchanced them, and also was able to place text over each header (and applying a CSS transition to it). I also am quite proud of my transitioning image on my 'about' page. Utilizing several positioning, sizing, and alignment factors, in addition to CSS transitions and keyframes, I feel like the transitioning image is the culmination of a lot of the course's topics.</p>
    
    <p>Despite these good factors of the website, there are a few different elements of the website that I feel could use some improvement. The first of these factors is the navigation bar. While this is the best navigation bar that I have made in this class so far, I feel like it could be more professional looking, or could even be rewritten as a drop down menu. Another factor that I feel can be improved is aligning some of the images/other media to the left side of the page. I initially attempted to do this, but a lot of the spacing of the text was adjusted in ways I did not particularly like when doing so, and by changing the text I would have ruined the consistency that I was trying to achieve in the web page. In order to improve the website, I think that the style of the website could be changed slightly to make these left-aligning images look less out of place.</p>
